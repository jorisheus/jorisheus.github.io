## Music

Making music started at the age of fifteen and quickly grew into my greatest passion. 
As a bass player I always play in the service of the music and the group in which 
I play. I think that's the best thing: when we can make music together that touches 
people. And that arises when the group trusts one another and everyone is willing to 
put his or her ego aside.

I play bass guitar and double bass in the following formations:

- [SOULID!](https://www.soulid.nu) – Soul/pop band
- [Neil Diamond Memories band](https://www.neildiamondmemories.com/) – De Nederlandse Neil Diamond Tribute band
- [Me and the Martians](https://www.meandthemartians.com/) – Eigen werk band

### Experience
I have been playing in various bands and projects since 2000. 
I started playing electric guitar when I was fifteen. Two years later I started 
playing bass guitar. I played both instruments for about ten years. 
In 2007 double bass was added. I have a lot of experience reading music through 
the many musical projects and big bands. I took lessons from Frank Mommers and 
Ratko Zjaca on guitar, and from Berry Jansen on bass guitar. In addition, 
I went to the Warwick bass camp in 2014, where I followed masterclasses from 
Victor Wooten, Armand Sabal-Lecco and Victor Bailey, among others.

I have played in:

- Soul/funk/pop bands
- Big bands
- Jazz combos
- Musical theater projects
- Theater productions
- Reggae bands

> As a musician he adapts to what is best for the end result at that moment.
